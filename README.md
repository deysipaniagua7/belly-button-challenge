# belly-button-challenge

This is the repository that holds my Module 14 belly-button-challenge.

Module Overview: The module asked us to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
We had to complete 3 parts: Bar Chart, Bubble Chart, and Metadata and Deployment.

-Bar Chart: We used D3 library to read in samples.json from a provided URL link. We then created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found (OTUs by Number of Bacteria) found in that individual.

-Bubble Chart: We created a bubble chart to display the Bacterial Cultures Per Sample (Number of Bacteria by OUT ID).

-Metadata and Deployment: We displayed the sampleâ€™s metadata (demographic info) by looping through each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object and creating a text string. WE also appended an html tag with that text to the #sample-metadata panel.
All plots are updated when a new sample is selected. Finally we were asked to deploy the app to GitHub Pages.

The main "belly-button-challenge" repo contains an 1) "index.html" file to generate the horizontal bar chart/bubble chart and 2) a "samples.json" file which houses the dataset for the module hw.

The ".vscode" subfolder contains a "settings.json" file.

The "static/js" subfolder contains a "app.js" file that houses my javascript code and a ".gitkeep" file.

Please note, I used in-class activities/notes and the following resources to complete my assignments:
